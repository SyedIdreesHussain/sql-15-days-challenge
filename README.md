# SQL 15 Days Challenge 🚀

This repository documents my **15-day SQL learning journey** using MySQL.

## Progress
- ✅ Day 1: SQL Basics (CREATE, INSERT, SELECT)
- ✅ Day 2: Filtering & column selection (WHERE, aliases)
- ✅ Day 3: Advanced filtering logic (BETWEEN, IN, NOT IN, AND / OR)

Each day includes hands-on practice queries and examples.

📌 Learning in public to stay consistent and improve every day.
